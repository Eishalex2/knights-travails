# Knights Travails

The Knights Travails project is a search algorithm which uses a a graph data structure to find the shortest path for a knight piece to get from one square to another on a chessboard. It is written in JavaScript and is console-only. 

The main part of the program is the `knightMoves` function. This function take two inputs: (1) the knight's initial starting place on the chessboard, and (2) the target destination. The function outputs how many moves it takes the knight piece to get from itss starting place to its target, as well as what those moves were.
